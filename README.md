[Neural Machine Translation](https://github.com/RishikeshDhayarkar/cs224n/tree/master/a5)
* Developed an NMT for Spanish to English translation.  This Seq2Seq network with Multiplicative Attentionincludes a character-based convolutional encoder with Highway layers and a character-based LSTM decoder.
* The character level decoder gets triggered when the word level decoder fails to translate
* Sub-word modelling helps in producing rare words, out of vocabulary target words, and also handles transliteration
