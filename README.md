* Conducted a statistical inference study on the General Social Survey dataset

### NYC taxi Dataset Analysis | python, pySpark, Hadoop
* Extensive exploration of NYC taxi dataset using Hadoop streaming. Includes fares, trips, and licences information
for all taxi trips for the years 2012 and 2013.(dataset size - 3 GB) | [Github](https://github.com/RishikeshDhayarkar/CS-GY-6513-Big-Data/tree/main/assignment_1)
* Thorough usage of Spark and SparkSQL to explore, analyse, and identify issues in NYC taxi dataset.(dataset size -
4.3 GB) | [Github](https://github.com/RishikeshDhayarkar/CS-GY-6513-Big-Data/tree/main/assignment_2)

### Question Answering on SQuAD 2.0 | [Github](https://github.com/RishikeshDhayarkar/CS-GY-9233-Deep-Learning) | pytorch, Nltk, Huggingface Transformers
* Utilized various tools and techniques such as Pre-trained Contextual Embeddings(PCE), Data Augmentation, and
merging PCE models with classical QA models such as BiDAF to solve the problem of question answering.
* Data Augmentation included synonym replacement and generating new sentences to augment the context
paragraphs in a coherent fashion. GLOVE embeddings in the BiDAF model were replaced by BERT embeddings.
Ensembling multiple models such as RoBERTa, BERT, ALBERT, and BiDAF models, we were able to achive a top
EM/F1 of 81.13/84.06.

### Adversarial Attacks on Spam Filters | [Github](https://github.com/RishikeshDhayarkar/ECE-GY-9163-ML-for-Cyber-Security/blob/main/A1/rbd291_ML_sec_A1.ipynb) | python, sklearn
* Performed feature selection using the information gain (IG) metric. Using these features Bernoulli Naive
Bayes(NB), Multinomial NB classifiers with binary and tern frequency features were implemented from scratch.
* Formalized the adversarial problem as a game between a cost- sensitive classifier and a cost-sensitive adversary.
Built a classifier that is optimal given the adversaryâ€™s attack strategy. The adversary immune classifier had a spam
recall of 94.28% and a spam precision of 78.75%

### Adversarial Attacks on Deep Neural Networks | python, tensorflow, keras
* Designed a backdoor detector for malicious neural nets trained on the YouTube Face dataset. Implemented a
modified version of this paper. Includes intentionally perturbing the incoming input, by superimposing various
image patterns and observe the randomness of the predicted classes for perturbed inputs from a deployed model. |
[Github](https://github.com/RishikeshDhayarkar/ML-security)
* Exhaustively investigated adversarial retraining as a defense against adversarial perturbations. Untargetted and
targetted attacks based on Fast Gradient Sign Methods(FSGM) were implemented. Experimentation was done to
analyse if adversarial retraining was a valid defense against these attacks. | [Github](https://github.com/RishikeshDhayarkar/ECE-GY-9163-ML-for-Cyber-Security/blob/main/A2/rbd291_ML_sec_A2.ipynb)

### Recommender System - !!!!! | [Github]() | python, pyspark
* Implemented a recommender system to predict the ratings/stars for the given user ids and business ids on the Yelp
reviews dataset. Collaborative Filtering algorithm was used and an RMS error of 1.115 was obtained using this
implementation

### LSH for Approximate Nearest Neighbours-!!!!! | [Github]() | python, pyspark
* Constructed an algorithm based on LSH to find similar businesses according to the customer ratings. This was
done on the Yelp reviews dataset and a similarity metric of Jaccard similarity was used.
* Performed a comparison of Linear Search and Approximate Nearest Neighbour search using LSH on a dataset of
images. Images of size 20x20 and a distance metric of L1 were used. LSH based approach had a speed-up of 4.21
over the linear search method.

### Generating Frequent itemsets-!!!!! | [Github]() | python, pyspark 
* Implemented an algorithm to find frequent businesses reviewed/visited by customers and frequent customers for all
businesses. SON algorithm on top of PCY was used on the Yelp reviews dataset to achieve this goal

### Sentiment Analysis using Contextual Embeddings-!!!!!|[Github]()|python, pytorch
