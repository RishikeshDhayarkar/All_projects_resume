[Neural Machine Translation](https://github.com/RishikeshDhayarkar/cs224n/tree/master/a5) | Python, Pytorch, Sklearn, Numpy, Nltk
* Developed an NMT for Spanish to English translation.  This Seq2Seq network with Multiplicative Attentionincludes a character-based convolutional encoder with Highway layers and a character-based LSTM decoder.
* The character level decoder gets triggered when the word level decoder fails to translate
* Sub-word modelling helps in producing rare words, out of vocabulary target words, and also handles transliteration

[Object detection]() | Python, Pytorch, Matplotlib, Numpy 
* Implemented a single stage detector, YOLO v2 from scratch.Trained and tested on PASCAL VOC 2007 dataset |
[Github](https://github.com/RishikeshDhayarkar/UMich-Computer-Vision/tree/master/yolo)
* This model was then enhanced to create a region proposal network with an ROI align function. Classification and
regression heads were attached on top of this to form a Two stage detector (FasterRCNN) | [Github](https://github.com/RishikeshDhayarkar/UMich-Computer-Vision/tree/master/fasterRCNN)
