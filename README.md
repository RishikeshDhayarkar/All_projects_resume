Neural Machine Translation 
Developed an NMT for Spanish to English translation.  This Seq2Seq network with Multiplicative Attentionincludes a character-based convolutional encoder with Highway layers and a character-based LSTM decoder. The character level decoder gets triggered when the word level decoder fails to translate. Sub-word modelling helps in producing rare words, out of vocabulary target words, and also handles transliteration.
